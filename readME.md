Summary: The bucket list app allows users to make a 10 item bucket list of things they want to do before they die. They are able to search within the app and see other users' bucket lists for pictures, resources etc...

1. Website landing page shows quick description of how to use it. If the visitor has already been to site, then they are automatically directed to community index page. New visitors will be prompted to sign up to make their personal bucket list.
2. After a user signs up, you are directed to the search page where you see other users’ lists. The user can search by term and it will filter and bold bucket list items that match what you search. The community index page shows users' picture thumbnails, name, and their lists. A user's name, when clicked, will take you to a ‘show page of their profile’ if you click on a specific list item, you are taken to the page of that single bucket list item. A short description and picture of the user is attached to their personal list.
3. Each list item page it contains:
    1. List item
    2. Picture
    3. Description
    4. Resource links
4. If I click a user’s name on the index community page, I am taken to their ENTIRE LIST, and I can scroll through their list items. This is the elaborate list item. If I only click on an item from their list on the index page, I am taken to that specific list item.
5. If I log in and click my own name in upper right corner, I am taken to my own list. This functions similar to the show page except you can edit. Any edits I make can be seen by other users and are reflected.
