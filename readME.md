App Created By: Brandon, Aubrey, Scott & Taylor


1. Website landing page shows quick description of how to use it. If the visitor has already been to site, then they are automatically directed to community index page. New visitors will be prompted to sign up to make their personal list.
2. After a user signs up, you are directed to the search page where you see other users’ lists. The user can search by term and it will filter and bold bucket list items that match what you search. The community index page shows users' picture thumbnails, name, and their lists. A user's name, when clicked, will take you to a ‘show page of their profile’ if you click on a specific list item, you are taken to the page of that single bucket list item. A short description and picture of the user is attached to their personal list.
3. Each list item page it contains:
    1. List item
    2. Picture
    3. Description
    4. Resource links
    5. Pre-Req icons (money, physical activity/fitness, time, danger) These are denoted by small icons.
4. If I click a user’s name on the index community page, I am taken to their ENTIRE LIST, and I can scroll through their list items. This is the elaborate list item. If I only click on an item from their list on the index page, I am taken to that specific list item.
5. If I log in and click my own name in upper right corner, I am taken to my own list. This functions similar to the show page except you can edit. Any edits I make can be seen by other users and are reflected.
6. Log-In & Auth via Facebook
7. Sendgrid API- Users will be able to email other users to ask questions about their bucket list items. When an item is completed, a user will get an email from the site congratulating them on their bucket list achievement.
8. Instagram API pulls in pictures of bucket list items.

STRETCHES
1. Completed items are archived in a folder attached to each user and will show up on a sidebar when matching terms are searched on the index page. IE: If I search skydiving, I can see that this was completed by certain users as well as see users who have this item still on their bucket list.
2. A user receives emails for suggested bucket list items. There is also a 'suggest my list' button on the user's personal page if they would like to have their list populated automatically.
